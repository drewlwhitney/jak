## Just Another Keyboard
It's just another keyboard that amalgamates the [Corne](github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep), and [Fifi](https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb).

Build instructions (and a ZMK module + possibly a QMK addition) coming in a few weeks when I get the board.
