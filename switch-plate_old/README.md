## Switch Plate
The switch plate is reversible and meant for MX-style switches (including the Gateron KS-33 Low Profile Switches).

## Ordering
This was written on January 7, 2026 for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

Upload the [PCB Gerber Files (.zip)](./gerber_to_order/) to [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), then leave everything as-is except for:

| Option | Value |
| -- | -- |
| PCB Color | Your choice |

Since JLCPCB requires you to order at least 5 copies of a board, you only need to order the switch plate once.
